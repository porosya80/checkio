# https://py.checkio.org/mission/between-markers/

# You are given a string and two markers (the initial and final). You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions:
# 
# The initial and final markers are always different.If there is no initial marker, then the first character should be considered the beginning of a string.If there is no final marker, then the last character should be considered the ending of a string.If the initial and final markers are missing then simply return the whole string.If the final marker comes before the initial marker, then return an empty string.Input:Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.
# 
# Output:A string.
# 
# Precondition:can't be more than one final marker and can't be more than one initial
#
