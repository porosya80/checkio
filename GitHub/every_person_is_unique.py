Let's simplify and slightly automate this process. Indeed, the simplification of routine processes is one of the key programming tasks.
# 
# You have to create a class ‘Person’ and a few methods to work with its instances. See the class description below.
# 
# classPerson(first_name, last_name, birth_date, job, working_years, salary, country, city, gender='unknown')
# 
# It returns a new instance  of the ‘Person’ class  with the name and surname [first_name,last_name], date of birth -birth_date(in 'dd.mm.yyyy' format), current job -job, number of working years -working_years, average salary -salary(per month), current country and city - [country,city] and gender -gender. The gender parameter could be 'male' or 'female'. If this parameter is undefined, the default value is - 'unknown'.
# 
# 
# Person(‘John’, ‘Smith’, ‘19.09.1979’, ‘welder’, 15, 3600, ‘Canada’, ‘Vancouver’, ‘male’) ==
# Person(‘John’, ‘Smith’, ‘19.09.1979’, ‘welder’, 15, 3600, ‘Canada’, ‘Vancouver’, ‘male’)
# 
# Person(‘Hanna Rose’, ‘May’, ‘05.12.1995’, ‘designer’, 2.2, 2150, ‘Austria’, ‘Vienna’) ==
# Person(‘Hanna Rose’, ‘May’, ‘05.12.1995’, ‘designer’, 2.2, 2150, ‘Austria’, ‘Vienna’, ‘unknown’)
# 
# name()
# 
# Returns the full name (name and surname, separated by a whitespace).
# 
# 
# Person (‘John’, ‘Smith’, ‘19.09.1979’, ‘welder’, 15, 3600, ‘Canada’, ‘Vancouver’, ‘male’).name() == ‘John Smith’
# 
# age()
# 
# Returns the person’s age - the number of fully lived years. (The current date is 01.01.2018)
# 
# 
# Person (‘John’, ‘Smith’, ‘19.09.1979’, ‘welder’, 15, 3600, ‘Canada’, ‘Vancouver’, ‘male’).age() == 38
# 
# work()
# 
# Returns the person’s job in a sentence as follows:‘He is a ...’ (if male)‘She is a ...’ (if female)‘Is a ...’ (if unknown)
# 
# 
# Person (‘Hanna Rose’, ‘May’, ‘05.12.1995’, ‘designer’, 2.2, 2150, ‘Austria’, ‘Vienna’).work() == ‘Is a designer’
# 
# money()
# 
# Returns an amount of money, earned during the working years. It should be returned in format xx xxx … - every 3 decimal places should be separated by a whitespace. For example:‘10 568’‘1 051 422’
# 
# 
# Person (‘John’, ‘Smith’, ‘19.09.1979’, ‘welder’, 15, 3600, ‘Canada’, ‘Vancouver’, ‘male’).money() == ‘648 000’
# 
# home()
# 
# Returns the country and the city where a person lives:‘Lives in the city, country’
# 
# 
# Person (‘Hanna Rose’, ‘May’, ‘05.12.1995’, ‘designer’, 2.2, 2150, ‘Austria’, ‘Vienna’).home() == ‘Lives in Vienna, Austria’
# 
# In this mission all data will be correct and you won't need to implement the value checking.
# 
# Input:Statements and expressions that use the ‘Person’ class.
# 
# Output:The behaviour of an instance as described above.
# 
# Precondition:All data is correct.
# 
# 
# END_DESC
