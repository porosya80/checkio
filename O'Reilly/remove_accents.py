# https://py.checkio.org/mission/remove-accents/

# Assuming you are developing a user based system like facebook, you will want to provide the functionality to search for other members regardless of the presence of accents in a username. Without using 3rd party collation library, you will need to remove the accents from username before comparison.
# 
# é - letter with accent; e - letter without accent; ̀ and ́ - stand alone accents;
# 
# Input:A phrase as a string (unicode)
# 
# Output:An accent free Unicode string.
# 
# How it is used:It might be a part username verification process or system that propose username based on first and last name of user
# 
# Precondition:0≤|input|≤40
# 
# 
# END_DESC
