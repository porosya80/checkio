# From a set of ints you have to create a list of closed intervals as tuples, so the intervals are covering all the values found in the set.
# In this mission you should use the 'yield' to make your function a generator.
# 
# A closed interval includes its endpoints! The interval1..5, for example,  includes each valuexthat satifies the condition1<= x<= 5.
# 
# Values can only be in the same interval if the difference between a value and the next  smaller value in the set equals one, otherwise a new interval begins. Of course, the  start value of an interval is excluded from this rule.
# A single value, that does not fit into an existing interval becomes the start- and  endpoint of a new interval.
# 
# Input:A set of ints.
# 
# Output:A list of tuples of two ints, indicating the endpoints of the interval. The list should be sorted by start point of each interval.
