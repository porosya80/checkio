# Our new calculator is censored and as such it does not accept certain words.    You should try to trick by writing a program to calculate the sum of numbers.
# 
# Given a list of numbers, you should find the sum of these numbers.    Your solution should not contain any of the banned words, even as a part of another word.
# 
# The list of banned words are as follows:
# 
# sumimportforwhilereduceInput:A list of numbers.
# 
# Output:The sum of numbers.
# 
# Precondition:The small amount of data. Let's creativity win!
