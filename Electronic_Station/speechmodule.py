# Stephen's speech module is broken.    This module is responsible for his number pronunciation.    He has to click to input all of the numerical digits in a figure,    so when there are big numbers it can take him a long time.    Help the robot to speak properly and increase his number processing speed by writing a new speech module for him.    All the words in the string must be separated by exactly one space character.    Be careful with spaces -- it's hard to see if you place two spaces instead one.
# 
# Input:A number as an integer.
# 
# Output:The string representation of the number as a string.
# 
# How it is used:This concept may be useful for the speech synthesis software or automatic reports systems.    This system can also be used when writing a chatbot by assigning words or phrases numerical    values and having a system retrieve responses based on those values.
# 
# Precondition:0 < number < 1000
