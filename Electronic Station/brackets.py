# “Great!” Exclaimed Sofia. “Now we have the password.”
# 
# “To what exactly?” Quipped Nikola.
# 
# “Untold treasures, vast riches beyond belief! Gold! Silver! Silicon! Hydraulic Fluid! Anything your heart        desires!”
# 
# “And you’re going to do what with a password to absolutely nothing?” Nikola smirked.
# 
# “Oh... Right...”
# 
# Stephen spoke up. “Well, this door back here has a keypad. Only thing is the brackets look pretty busted up. We        could try fixing it and then punching in the password?”
# 
# “YES! That!” Sofia exclaimed.
# 
# You are given an expression with numbers, brackets and operators.    For this task only the brackets matter. Brackets come in three flavors: "{}" "()" or "[]".    Brackets are used to determine scope or to restrict some expression.     If a bracket is open, then it must be closed with a closing bracket of the same type.     The scope of a bracket must not intersected by another bracket.     In this task you should make a decision, whether to correct an expression or not based on the brackets.     Do not worry about operators and operands.
# 
# Input:An expression with different of types brackets as a string (unicode).
# 
# Output:A verdict on the correctness of the expression in boolean (True or False).
# 
# Precondition:
# There are only brackets ("{}" "()" or "[]"), digits or operators ("+" "-" "*" "/").
# 0 < len(expression) < 103
